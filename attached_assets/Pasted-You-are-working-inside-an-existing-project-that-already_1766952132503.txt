You are working inside an existing project that already contains:
- a calendar / schedule (critical path or gantt-like),
- WorkItem entities,
- WorkPlan and WorkFact (plan/fact tracking).

DO NOT rewrite or replace existing logic.
Extend the project conservatively.

GOAL:
Add a flexible internal classification system used by the BIM team
to hierarchically classify contracts, PDCs, works and sub-works.
The classification must not be primary data and must not break
existing entities if changed or deleted.

CONCEPTUAL RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
1. Contracts, budgets and PDCs are PRIMARY and exist independently.
2. Classification codes are SECONDARY and can change freely.
3. Deleting a classification code must NOT delete or invalidate works.
4. Each work can have at most ONE classification code.
5. Classification is project-specific.
6. Codes are human-readable paths, not identifiers.

CLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY:
Contract           → Code like: C01
PDC                → Code like: C01.P01
Work               → Code like: C01.P01.W01
Sub-work           → Code like: C01.P01.W01.S01

DATA MODEL TO ADD:

1) Classification codes table:
- id (uuid, PK)
- project_id
- parent_id (self FK, nullable)
- code (string, editable)
- name
- is_deleted (boolean)

2) Assignment table (soft link):
- id (uuid, PK)
- entity_type (enum: Contract | PDC | WorkItem)
- entity_id (uuid)
- classification_code_id (nullable FK)
- assigned_at

IMPORTANT:
- entity_id refers to existing entities, do NOT change them.
- classification_code_id must be nullable.
- No cascade deletes.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Allow creating, renaming, moving and soft-deleting classification codes.
- Allow assigning a classification code to:
  - a contract,
  - a PDC,
  - a WorkItem.
- If a classification code is deleted, assignments remain,
  but classification_code_id becomes NULL.
- Work plan/fact logic must continue to work unchanged.

CALENDAR / SCHEDULE INTEGRATION:
- Add optional filtering/grouping of works by classification code prefix
  (example: "C01.P01.*").
- Do NOT change existing schedule calculations.

DELIVERABLES:
1) Database migrations / schema changes.
2) Backend models and services.
3) Minimal API endpoints:
   - CRUD classification codes
   - assign / unassign code to entity
4) Basic validation (one work = one code max).
5) Short README explaining how classification integrates
   with existing plan/fact and schedule.

DO NOT:
- Refactor unrelated code.
- Introduce hard FK dependency from WorkItem to classification.
- Change business logic of plan/fact or schedule.
